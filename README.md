# Problem Definition

Duplicate questions on community-driven platforms like Quora hinder user experience, reduce content discovery efficiency, and add unnecessary load to the system. Identifying and filtering out these duplicate questions is essential for maintaining a clean and relevant question database. However, detecting duplicates is challenging due to variations in wording, sentence structure, and semantics.

This project addresses the problem by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a robust system capable of efficiently detecting duplicate questions. By implementing advanced text preprocessing steps such as tokenization and semantic similarity measures, the solution aims to identify questions with similar intent, even when their textual representations differ. This approach enhances system accuracy, optimizes search results, and improves user engagement.
